            <p>🦁 Paragraph 1 – General Information
Lions are one of the most iconic wild cats found primarily in Africa. Known as the “King of the Jungle,” lions live in groups called prides, which typically consist of females, their cubs, and a few males. Male lions are easily recognized by their majestic manes, which make them appear larger and more intimidating to rivals and predators.</p>

            <p>🦁 Paragraph 2 – Hunting & Lifestyle
Lions are carnivores and skilled hunters, often working together in a group to catch prey such as zebras, antelopes, and wildebeests. Interestingly, it's mostly the lionesses who do the hunting while males guard the territory. Lions spend a large portion of their day resting—sometimes sleeping up to 20 hours</p>

Throughout history, lions have symbolized strength, courage, and royalty. They appear in flags, statues, and legends in many cultures around the world. Despite their power, lions are currently vulnerable due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans, making conservation efforts very important.</p>
