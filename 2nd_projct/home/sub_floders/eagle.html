            <p>LðŸ¦… Paragraph 1 â€“ General Information
                Eagles are large birds of prey known for their sharp vision, powerful wings, and strong beaks. They are
                found all over the world, especially in mountains, forests, and near rivers. With wingspans that can
                reach over 7 feet, eagles are excellent flyers and skilled hunters.</p>

            <p>ðŸ¦… Paragraph 2 â€“ Hunting & Abilities
                Eagles have incredible eyesight â€” up to 4 to 5 times stronger than that of a human. This helps them spot
                prey such as fish, rabbits, and snakes from high in the sky. They use their sharp talons to grab and
                carry their catch. Eagles build large nests called eyries, often high up on cliffs or tall trees.</p>

            <p>ðŸ¦… Paragraph 3 â€“ Symbolism & Cultural Importance
                Eagles are symbols of strength, freedom, and courage in many cultures. They appear on national flags and
                emblems, including that of the United States. Revered in ancient mythology and modern history alike, the
                eagle represents leadership and vision, soaring high above challenges.</p>
