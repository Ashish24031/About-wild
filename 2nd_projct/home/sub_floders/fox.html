            <p>üê∫ Paragraph 1 ‚Äì General Information
                Wolves are wild carnivorous mammals known for their sharp intelligence, teamwork, and haunting howls.
                They belong to the canine family and are closely related to domestic dogs. Wolves are typically found in
                forests, tundras, and mountains across North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

            <p>üê∫ Paragraph 2 ‚Äì Pack Behavior & Hunting
                Wolves live and hunt in family groups called packs, which can include up to 15 members. They work
                together to hunt large prey like deer, elk, or moose. Their communication is advanced, using howls, body
                language, and scent marking to coordinate and protect their territory..</p>

            <p>üê∫ Paragraph 3 ‚Äì Symbolism & Conservation
                Wolves are often seen as symbols of freedom, strength, and loyalty in many cultures. Though once hunted
                to near extinction in some areas, conservation programs have helped reintroduce wolves into protected
                habitats. Their return plays a key role in maintaining balance within ecosystems by controlling prey
                populations.</p>
