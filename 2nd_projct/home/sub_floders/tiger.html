            <p>🐅 Paragraph 1 – General Information
                Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are easily recognized by their orange fur with
                black stripes. Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints. They are
                solitary animals, preferring to live and hunt alone in dense forests or grasslands, mainly across Asia.

            <p>🐅 Paragraph 2 – Hunting & Strength
Tigers are powerful predators with strong muscles, sharp claws, and excellent night vision. They silently stalk their prey, such as deer or wild boar, and use a quick pounce to take them down. A single tiger can leap over 20 feet in a single bound and drag prey much heavier than itself over long distances.</p>

            <p>🐅 Paragraph 3 – Conservation & Importance
Tigers are endangered due to illegal hunting (poaching) and habitat destruction. Once roaming vast parts of Asia, their population has drastically declined. Today, global efforts are being made to protect them in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Tigers are not only a symbol of wildlife beauty but also play a crucial role in maintaining balance in ecosystems.</p>
