            <p>ðŸ¦“ Paragraph 1 â€“ General Information
                Zebras are wild animals best known for their striking black and white stripes. Each zebra has a unique
                pattern, just like human fingerprints. They belong to the horse family and are found mainly in the
                grasslands and savannas of Africa, living in groups called herds.</p>

            <p>ðŸ¦“ Paragraph 2 â€“ Behavior & Survival
                Zebras are social animals that stay in groups for protection against predators like lions and hyenas.
                Their stripes may help confuse attackers during a chase or serve as camouflage in tall grass. Zebras can
                run up to 65 km/h and use powerful kicks to defend themselves from threats.</p>

            <p>ðŸ¦“ Paragraph 3 â€“ Role in Nature & Conservation
                Zebras play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem by grazing on grasses, which promotes plant
                growth. While not currently endangered, some zebra species face threats due to habitat loss and hunting.
                Conservation efforts help protect their natural environment and ensure they continue to thrive in the
                wild.</p>
