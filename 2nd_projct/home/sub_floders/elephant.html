                🐘 Paragraph 1 – General Information
                Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their massive size, long trunks, and large
                ears. There are two main species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. These intelligent and
                social animals live in herds and are found in forests, grasslands, and savannas across Africa and Asia.

            <p>🐘 Paragraph 2 – Behavior & Intelligence
                Elephants are highly intelligent creatures with excellent memory and strong emotional bonds. They can
                recognize themselves in mirrors, use tools, and even mourn their dead. Their trunks are powerful and
                sensitive, used for drinking water, picking up objects, and even greeting other elephants.</p>

                🐘 Paragraph 3 – Cultural & Environmental Role
                Elephants hold great cultural importance in many countries, especially in India and Thailand, where they
                are seen as symbols of wisdom and strength. Ecologically, elephants help maintain forest and grassland
                ecosystems by spreading seeds and creating water holes. Sadly, they are threatened by poaching and
                habitat loss, making conservation efforts essential.
