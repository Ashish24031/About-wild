            <p>🐱 Paragraph 1 – General Information
                Cats are small, furry mammals known for their playful nature, sharp reflexes, and independence. They
                have been kept as pets for over 9,000 years and are one of the most popular domestic animals worldwide.
                Cats are natural hunters, using their keen senses and agility to catch small prey like mice and birds.

                are clean animals that spend a large amount of time grooming themselves with their rough tongues.</p>
