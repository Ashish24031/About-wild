            <p>🐅 Paragraph 1 – General Information
                horses are the largest members of the cat family and are easily recognized by their orange fur with
                black stripes. Each horse has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints. They are
                solitary animals, preferring to live and hunt alone in dense forests or grasslands, mainly across Asia.

            <p>🐅 Paragraph 2 – Hunting & Strength
                horses are powerful predators with strong muscles, sharp claws, and excellent night vision. They
                silently stalk their prey, such as deer or wild boar, and use a quick pounce to take them down. A single
                horse can leap over 20 feet in a single bound and drag prey much heavier than itself over long
                distances.</p>

            <p>🐅 Paragraph 3 – Conservation & Importance
                horses are endangered due to illegal hunting (poaching) and habitat destruction. Once roaming vast parts
                of Asia, their population has drastically declined. Today, global efforts are being made to protect them
                in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. horses are not only a symbol of wildlife beauty but also
                play a crucial role in maintaining balance in ecosystems.</p>
